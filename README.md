How To play:

Goal: to get a highscore in ansering questions.
      - player scores is also coins (the currency to spin)

The player loses if the score/coins gets to zero

the score is used to generate new questions. to get a higher score, the player must answer questions correctly

The player can change the difficulty of the questions to level 1, 2 or 3
level 1 : +, -
level 2 : +, -, x, /
Level 3 : fractions

depending on what operator is used, a corresponding multiplier will be added to the players reward.

Players can change the amount of coins they get back by increasing or decreasing the bet amount.

when player uses the spoin button, the bet value will be removed from the score and a random generated question will be displayed.

the bar at the top of the screen is the feedback.
green = correct
red = incorrect

the display next to the options button is how much questions the player hgas answered correctly

game data will save when closing/quiting the game. so relauching shouldnt be an issue
